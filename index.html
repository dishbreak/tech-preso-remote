						<h3>Many moons ago, I was in charge of an internship
						program.</h2>
						<p class="fragment">My job was to provide them curriculum
						and development.</p>
						<p class="fragment">(yes, as nebulous as it sounds)</p>
						<p class="fragment">I decided technical presentation was
						an important part of that task.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>In a lot of ways, those interns were like you.</h3>
						<p class="fragment">They were early in their
						technical careers.</p>
						<p class="fragment">They had novel and interesting ideas.</p>
						<p class="fragment">They were highly effective engineers.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>But you're also different from them.</h3>
						<p class="fragment">You routinely collaborate across
						teams.</p>
						<p class="fragment">You've got experience as an
						intern.</p>
						<p class="fragment"><b>You're working from home during a
						global pandemic.</b></p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h1>
							Is this talk still relevant?
						</h1>
						<p class="fragment">Spoiler: I think so.</p>
						<p class="fragment">Let's go over the basics first.</p>

						<h3>The Three Elements of Technical
							Presentation</h3>
						<ol>
							<li class="fragment"><b>The Audience.</b> Who
								are you presenting to?</li>
							<li class="fragment"><b>The Story.</b> What are
								you telling your audience?</li>
							<li class="fragment"><b>The Delivery.</b> How
								will you tell your audience your story?</li>
						</ol>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>The Audience</h3>
						<p class="fragment">What are the <i>capacities</i> and
						<i>capabilities</i> of the people you're presenting
						to?</p>
						<p class="fragment">What's the <b>use case</b> for your
						presentation?</p>
						<p class="fragment">How can your audience help you?</p>
						<p class="fragment"><b>Your audience is the key driver.</b></p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>The Story</h3>
						<p class="fragment">How are you of use to your
						audience?</p>
						<p class="fragment">What are your core ideas?</p>
						<p class="fragment">What will you ask of your audience?</p>
						<p class="fragment"><b>Focus on giving your audience as
								much value as possible.</b></p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>The Delivery</h3>
						<p class="fragment">Nobody wants to be a boring
						presenter.</p>
						<p class="fragment">Keep your tone light and
						conversational.</p>
						<p class="fragment">Use stories and narratives to
						illustrate and convey your point.</p>
						<p class="fragment"><b>You're not presenting, you're
						just talking.</b></p>

						<h3>Working through a pandemic is hard.</h3>
						<p class="fragment">A lot of us feel like ducks paddling in
						water.</p>
						<p class="fragment">There's more ways to get distracted.</p>
						<p class="fragment">Many of us have multiple roles to fill
						at home and at work.</p>
						<p class="fragment"><b>Your audience has to work a lot harder.</b></p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Zoom presentations just aren't as interactive.</h3>
						<p class="fragment">Shared physical space lets us transmit
						more nonverbal cues.</p>
						<p class="fragment">Delays of even a second <a
						href="https://slate.com/technology/2014/05/transmission-delays-in-internet-communications-affect-the-way-people-perceive-each-other.html">hamper
						our communications</a>.</p>
						<p class="fragment">It's even harder to "read the room" when
						it's not actually a room.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>But, there is still some opportunity.</h3>
						<p class="fragment">Challenging times force us to rethink
						things we normally just accept.</p>
						<p class="fragment">A virtual setting can be a chance for
						you to try new techniques!</p>
						<p class="fragment"><b>Our need to communicate hasn't
						changed.</b></p>

						<h3>Physical presentations have constraints.</h3>
						<p class="fragment">There's only so many conference
						rooms.</p>
						<p class="fragment">You have to coordinate around when
						people are in the office.</p>
						<p class="fragment"><b>The cost of physical presentations
						are a limiting factor.</b></p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>With virtual presentations, we can invite everyone to
						everything!</h3>
						<p class="fragment">Is that really a good idea, though?</p>
						<p class="fragment">Presentations are still expensive for
						attendees.</p>
						<p class="fragment">It's a huge drag for an attendee to
						be in a presentation they don't need to be in.</p>
						<p class="fragment"><b>What can you do to help?</b></p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Manage the size of your audience.</h3>
						<p class="fragment">Use the "optional" feature to let
						attendees know that they can skip if they want.</p>
						<p class="fragment">When you <i>need</i> to have a
						larger meeting, appoint an MC to run your chat and
						collect feedback.</p>

						<h1>Get your story straight.</h1>

						<h3>Physical presentations can be relatively
						unstructured.</h3>
						<p class="fragment">With the right group, you can have a
						productive meeting even if you have a loose agenda.</p>
						<p class="fragment">Ideation and brainstorming is easier
						when you have body language.</p>
						<p class="fragment"><b>When you're all in the same room
						you can muddle through a meeting.</b></p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Virtual presentations need more structure.</h3>
						<p class="fragment">Virtual presentations are inherently less
						interactive.</p>
						<p class="fragment">An unclear agenda or an unfocused
						discussion will push people to tune out.</p>
						<p class="fragment">Your audience needs to know what's
						expected of them.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Have a clear agenda for your presentation.</h3>
						<p class="fragment">Set acceptance criteria for the
						presentation. What will make it a success?</p>
						<p class="fragment">Make it easier for people to follow
						up with the results of the discussion. Publish your slides,
						meeting notes, RFCs, etc.</p>

						and audiences.</p>
						<p class="fragment">Reduce your audience size where possible to keep
						things high and tight.</p>
						<p class="fragment">Put in the work to have organized
						presentations with a clear agenda.</p>
						<p class="fragment">Go the extra mile to make your talks
